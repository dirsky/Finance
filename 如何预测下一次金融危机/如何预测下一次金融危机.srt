1
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,310
曾经
Once upon a time

2
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,470
我们生活在一个金融增长和繁荣的经济体之中
we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,610
这被称作"大稳健"时期
This was called the Great Moderation

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:31,110
大多数经济学家 政府决策者 以及央行都错误地认为
the misguided belief by most economists, policymakers, and central banks

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:38,460
我们正在步入一个增长和繁荣永远不会停止的新世界
that we have transformed into a new world of never ending growth and prosperity

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,250
这段时期见证了稳健的GDP增长
This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth

7
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,810
受控良好的低通胀
by low and controlled inflation

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,010
低失业率
by low unemployment

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,330
以及受控良好的低金融波动
and controlled and low financial volatility

10
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:59,090
但2007-2008年发生了"大衰退"
But the Great Recession in 2007-2008

11
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,940
这次大崩溃打破了这一幻想
the great crash, broke this illusion

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,420
金融业损失数千亿美元
A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,370
并进一步导致全世界5万亿美元的GDP损失
cascaded into $5 trillion of losses in world GDP

14
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:20,030
以及将近30万亿美元的全球股市损失
and almost $30 trillion losses in global stock market

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,860
而对"大衰退"的理解却是
So the understanding of this Great Recession was that

16
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,700
它完全是意外
this was completely surprising

17
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,670
突如其来 犹如上天之怒
this came out of the blue; this was like the wrath of the gods

18
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,940
我们无能为力
There was no responsibility

19
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,540
为了反思这些 我们创立了金融危机观测台
So as a reflection of this, we started the Financial Crisis Observatory

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,090
我们的目标是实时诊断金融泡沫
We had the goal to diagnose, in real-time, financial bubbles

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,890
并提前鉴别出它们的临界时间
and identify in advance their critical time

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
这一金融观测台的科学基础是什么呢
What is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?

23
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,700
我们提出了一个理论 名曰"龙王"
We developed a theory called "dragon-kings"

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,290
龙王代表同类事件中的极端事件
Dragon-kings represent extreme events which are of a class of their own

25
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,370
它们很特殊
They're special

26
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,820
它们是异常情况
They're outliers

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,550
它们是特定机制所造成的
They're generated by specific mechanism

28
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,160
可能具有可预测性
that may make them predictable

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,710
甚至可控性
perhaps controllable

30
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,780
考虑金融价格的时间序列
Consider the financial price time series

31
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,100
某种股票 你最好的股票
a given stock, your perfect stock

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,170
或者说全球指数
or global index

33
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,270
你有这些上下波动
You have these up-and-downs

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,230
金融市场风险的很好度量
A very good measure of the risk of this financial market

35
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,140
是表示最坏情形的峰谷差值
is the peaks-to-valleys that represent the worst case scenario

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,000
你在最高时买进 却在最低时卖出
when you bought at the top, and sold at the bottom

37
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,050
你可以参考统计数字
You can look at the statistics

38
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,510
考虑不同规模峰谷差值的出现频率
the frequency of the occurrence of peak-to-valleys of different sizes

39
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,790
也就是这张图中所表示的
which is represented in this graph

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,820
有趣的是 不同幅值的峰谷差值中 有99%
Now interestingly, 99% of the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes

41
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,270
能用具有普遍性的幂定律来表示
can be represented by a universal power law

42
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,990
这里表示为这条红线
represented by this red line here

43
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,100
更有趣的是
More interestingly

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,790
存在一些离群值 一些异常值落在红线上方
there are outliers, there are exceptions which are above this red line

45
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,970
发生频率要比预测值高出至少100倍
occur 100 times more frequently

46
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,520
发生频率要比预测值高出至少100倍
at least, than, the extrapolation would predict them to occur

47
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,730
这里预计是基于剩余99%峰谷差值校准的情况
based on the calibration of the 99% remaining peak-to-valleys

48
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,190
这些离群值是由暂态依赖性所造成的
They are due to transient dependencies

49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,180
使得一个损失接着另一个损失
such that a loss is followed by a loss

50
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,580
接着另一个损失 接着另一个损失
which is followed by a loss, which is followed by a loss

51
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,270
这种依赖性
These kinds of dependencies

52
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,400
在当今的标准风险管理工具中 很大程度被忽视了
are largely missed by standard risk management tools

53
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,550
标准工具将它们看作是"蜥蜴"
which ignore them and see lizards

54
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,630
其实它们应该被看作"龙王"
while they should see dragon-kings

55
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,450
这些龙王的根本机制
The root mechanism of a dragon-king

56
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,730
是一种缓慢成熟 逐渐趋向不稳定
is a slow maturation towards instability

57
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,950
也就是泡沫
which is the bubble

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,810
而泡沫发展到极致 通常会导致崩溃
and the climax of the bubble is often the crash

59
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,560
这类似于试管中水的缓慢升温过程
This is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube

60
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,360
逐渐逼近沸点
reaching the boiling point

61
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,920
当水的不稳定性爆发时
where the instability of the water occurs

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,290
就会产生相变 由水变为蒸气
and you have the phase transition to vapor

63
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,850
这个过程 肯定不是线性的
And this process, which is absolutely non-linear --

64
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,420
不能用标准技术来预测
cannot be predicted by standard techniques --

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,380
是集体突发行为的反映
is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior

66
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,410
具有根本的内生性
which is fundamentally endogenous

67
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,950
因此 崩溃的原因 危机的原因
So the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisis

68
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,210
必须在系统的不稳定性内部寻找
has to be found in an inner instability of the system

69
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,940
任何微小的扰动 都会让不稳定性爆发
and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur

70
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,100
你们有些人这时可能也意识到了
Now some of you may have come to the mind that

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,630
这不是和你们经常听到的黑天鹅理论相关吗
is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently?

72
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,190
黑天鹅这种鸟 欧洲人第一次看到后
Remember, black swan is this rare bird that you see once

73
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,840
天鹅都是白的这种固有认识就被彻底颠覆
and suddenly shattered your belief that all swans should be white

74
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,030
我们用黑天鹅理论来描述不可预测性 不可知性
so it has captured the idea of unpredictability, unknowability

75
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,250
认为极端事件根本上是不可知的
that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable

76
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,920
而我所提出的龙王理论恰好同它相反
Nothing can be further from the dragon-king concept I propose

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,880
龙王理论认为
which is exactly the opposite

78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,000
大多数极端事件都是可知的 都是可预测的
that most extreme events are actually knowable and predictable

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,500
所以我们有能力担起责任
So we can be empowered and take responsibility

80
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,720
对它们进行预测
and make predictions about them

81
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,920
让我的龙王烧掉这种黑天鹅理论
So let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept

82
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,360
根据龙王理论 早期有很多警报信号是可预测的
There are many early warning signals that are predicted by this theory

83
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,730
这里我将集中讨论其中一个
Let me just focus on one of them:

84
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,880
即带有正反馈的超指数增长
the super-exponential growth with positive feedback

85
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,040
什么意思呢
What does it mean?

86
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,220
假设你有一个投资
Imagine you have an investment

87
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,990
第一年回报是5%
that returns the first year 5 percent

88
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,530
第二年10% 第三年20%
the second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent

89
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,070
第四年40% 这太了不起了 对吧
the next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?

90
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,470
这就是一个超指数增长
This is a super-exponential growth

91
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,400
不像标准指数增长
A standard exponential growth corresponds

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,340
指的是一种常数增长率 比如10%
to a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percent

93
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,630
问题在于 很多存在泡沫的时候
The point is that, many times during bubbles

94
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,220
这些正反馈可能出现很多次
there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times

95
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,920
使得之前的增长被增强
such that previous growths enhance

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,410
往前推进 提升下一次增长
push forward, increase the next growth

97
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,410
这都是通过这种超指数增长实现的
through this kind of super-exponential growth which is

98
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,030
而这种增长是暂态的 不能持久的
very transient, not sustainable

99
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,540
关键在于 这类模型的数学解
And the key idea is that the mathematical solution of this class of models

100
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,540
表现出有限时间奇异性 也就是说
exhibit finite-time singularities, which means

101
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,340
存在一个临界时间
that there is a critical time

102
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,280
此时系统会突变 会发生质变
where the system will break, will change regime

103
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,560
这可能是崩溃 也可能是达到平稳水平 等等
It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,820
关键在于 这个临界时间
And the key idea is that the critical time

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,350
它的信息包含于
the information about the critical time is contained

106
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,910
这个超指数增长的早期发展之中
in the early development of this super-exponential growth

107
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,200
我们很早就将这个理论 这是理论的首次成功
We have applied this theory early on, that was our first success

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,250
用于诊断阿丽亚娜火箭关键部件的破裂
to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the Ariane rocket

109
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,800
我们使用声发射检验
Using acoustic emission

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,400
这些结构会发射小声波 对你"唱歌"
you know, this little noise that you hear a structure emit, sing to you

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,090
当它们受到压力 就会揭示出损坏的发生
when they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on

112
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,530
存在正反馈的集体现象
there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback

113
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,230
更多损坏会导致更多损坏
the more damage gives the more damage

114
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,650
于是就能在误差范围内预测出
so you can actually predict, within, of course, a probability band

115
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,760
破裂会何时出现
when the rupture will occur

116
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,360
这个现在非常成功
So this is now so successful

117
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,560
被用于检验能否飞行的初始阶段
that it is used in the initial phase of can we be flying the flight

118
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,380
也许更让人吃惊的是
Perhaps more surprisingly

119
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,090
相同理论还适用于生物和医药
the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine

120
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,270
分娩 生产 癫痫发作
parturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures

121
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,510
从怀孕后7个月开始
From 7 months of pregnancy

122
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:43,080
母亲开始感受到偶发的子宫收缩
a mother starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus

123
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,130
这预示着趋向不稳定的成熟过程
that are the sign of these maturations toward the instability

124
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,270
要生小孩了 这就是龙王
giving birth to the baby, the dragon-king

125
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,580
如果你去测量前导信号
So if you measure the precursor signal

126
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:02,490
你将能够提前鉴别出成熟前和成熟后的问题
you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems in advance

127
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,040
癫痫发作 也会以各种不同规模出现
Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size

128
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,320
当脑达到一个超临界状态时
and when the brain goes to a super-critical state

129
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,890
你会有龙王 它具有一定程度的可预测性
you have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability

130
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,640
这能帮助病人处理这种疾病
and this can help the patient to deal with this illness

131
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,580
我们将这个理论用到很多系统中
We have applied this theory to many systems

132
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,440
山体滑坡 冰川崩塌
landslides, glacier collapse

133
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,010
甚至用于成功预测动态
even to the dynamics of prediction of success:

134
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,390
包括大片 YouTube视频 电影这些
blockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on

135
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,340
但也许 它的最大应用是在金融上
But perhaps the most important application is for finance

136
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,000
我相信 这种理论阐明了
and this theory illuminates, I believe

137
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,030
我们所经历的金融危机的深层次原因
the deep reason for the financial crisis that we have gone through

138
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,080
这根植于30年的泡沫历史
This is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles

139
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,880
从1980年开始 1987年全球泡沫破灭
starting in 1980, with the global bubble crashing in 1987

140
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,240
紧接着又有很多泡沫产生
followed by many other bubbles

141
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,880
最大的一个是 2000年破灭的新经济互联网泡沫
The biggest one was the new economy Internet bubble in 2000, crashing in 2000

142
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,930
之后是很多国家的房地产泡沫
the real estate bubbles in many countries

143
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,710
各地的金融衍生品泡沫
financial derivative bubbles everywhere

144
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,000
各地的股市泡沫
stock market bubbles also everywhere

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,950
商品和石油泡沫 债务和信贷泡沫
commodity and oil bubbles, debt and credit bubbles --

146
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,970
泡沫 泡沫 泡沫
bubbles, bubbles, bubbles

147
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,300
我们有一个全球泡沫
We had a global bubble

148
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,430
这是对全球所有市场过高估计的测量
This is a measure of global overvaluation of all markets

149
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,730
表示出我所说的永恒印钞机错觉
expressing what I call an illusion of a perpetual money machine

150
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,150
它在2007年最终崩溃
that suddenly broke in 2007

151
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,410
问题在于我们现在总看到相同的策略
The problem is that we see the same process

152
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,650
特别是通过量化宽松
in particular through quantitative easing

153
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,830
各国政府总想着永恒开启印钞机
of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays

154
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,780
2008年以来的美国 欧洲 日本 都希望这样来应对危机
to tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe, in Japan

155
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,780
这具有非常重要的意义 能帮助我们理解
This has very important implications to understand

156
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,580
量化宽松以及紧缩政策的失败
the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures

157
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,680
我们并没有攻击问题的核心
as long as we don't attack the core

158
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,300
这种永恒印钞机思维的结构性原因
the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking

159
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,490
以上都是大的论断
Now, these are big claims

160
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,650
你们干嘛要相信我呢
Why would you believe me?

161
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,150
也许是因为在过去15年中
Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 years

162
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,440
我们从象牙塔中走了出来
we have come out of our ivory tower

163
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,970
开始发表"事前"…
and started to publish ex ante --

164
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,500
我强调"事前" 也就是事情发生之前
and I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance"

165
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,670
在崩盘之前
before the crash

166
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,330
确定泡沫或金融过剩的存在
confirmed the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses

167
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,050
这些是近期历史中
These are a few of the major bubbles

168
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,020
我们经历过的一些主要泡沫
that we have lived through in recent history

169
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,370
它们每一个都有自己的有趣故事
Again, many interesting stories for each of them

170
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,130
我将只介绍一到两个我们处理大型泡沫的故事
Let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles

171
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,460
我们都知道中国奇迹
We all know the Chinese miracle

172
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,890
这是股市大泡沫的图示
This is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble

173
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,870
短短几年间 价格指数就涨到了原来的三倍 300%
you know, a factor of three, 300% in just a few years

174
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,790
2007年9月
In September 2007

175
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,880
我被邀请到一个宏观对冲基金管理会议作主题演讲
I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund management conference

176
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,940
我在会议上展示了一个预测
and I showed to the conference a prediction

177
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,820
即到2007年末 这个泡沫会发生质变
that by the end of 2007, this bubble would change regime

178
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,670
可能会出现崩盘 不可持续是肯定的
There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable

179
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,410
你们觉得这些
Now, how do you believe

180
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:27,860
极度聪明 积极上进 见多识广的宏观对冲基金经理人
the very smart, very motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managers

181
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,810
会对该预测作何反应
reacted to this prediction?

182
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:34,080
他们在这个泡沫上已经赚了数十亿
You know, they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now

183
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,220
他们跟我说 "迪迪埃 对 市场价值可能被高估了"
They told me, "Didier, yeah, the market might be overvalued

184
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,120
"但你忘了"
but you forget something

185
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,980
"2008年8月北京奥运即将开始"
There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming in August 2008

186
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,930
"很明显 中国政府会控制经济"
and it's very clear that the Chinese government is controlling the economy

187
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,280
"采取一切手段"
and doing what it takes

188
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,840
"来控制股市并避免任何波动"
to also avoid any wave and control the stock market"

189
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,200
我演讲过后三周
Three weeks after my presentation

190
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,320
市场损失20%
the markets lost 20 percent

191
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,480
经历了一番剧烈波动之后
and went through a phase of volatility, upheaval

192
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,580
到年底总市场价值损失70%
and a total market loss of 70 percent until the end of the year

193
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,460
我们为什么会集体犯下这种错误
So how can we be so collectively wrong

194
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,600
会误读甚至忽略这种科学事实
by misreading or ignoring the science

195
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,690
也就是 当不稳定发展起来 系统成熟之时
of the fact that when an instability has developed and the system is ripe

196
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,200
任何扰动
any perturbation

197
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,460
都会让整个系统无法控制
makes it essentially impossible to control?

198
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,560
中国市场崩溃了 但之后它又复苏了
The Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded

199
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,930
2009年 我们又辨别出一个较小的新泡沫
In 2009, we also identified that this new bubble, a smaller one

200
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,610
是不可持续的
was unsustainable

201
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,240
我们又提前发布了一个预测
so we published again a prediction, in advance

202
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,570
说2009年8月前 市场会进行调整
stating that by August 2009, the market will correct

203
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,690
将不会继续原有道路
will not continue on this track

204
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,240
批评我们的人 读到预测后说
Our critics, reading the prediction, said

205
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,310
"不 这不可能"
"No, it's not possible

206
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,810
"有中国政府呢"
The Chinese government is there

207
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,490
"他们吸取了教训 他们会控制的"
They have learned their lesson. They will control

208
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,300
"他们也想从增长中获益"
They want to benefit from the growth"

209
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,950
也许没有吸取教训的是这些批评者自己
Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously

210
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,580
危机确实发生 市场进行了调整
So the crisis did occur. The market corrected

211
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,120
还是之前的批评者 说 "啊 是"
The same critics then said, "Ah, yes

212
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,970
"但你发布了你的预测"
but you published your prediction

213
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,620
"你影响了市场"
You influenced the market

214
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,320
"这就不是预测了"
It was not a prediction"

215
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,200
也许我当时很有影响力
Maybe I am very powerful then

216
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,160
这就有趣了
Now, this is interesting

217
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,220
这显示出目前为止 要发展出一门经济科学几乎是不可能的
It shows that it's essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics

218
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,690
因为我们都是有情感的人类 我们会去预料
because we are sentient beings who anticipate

219
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,430
自我应验的预言会成为问题
and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies

220
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,160
于是我们发明了一种新的科学方法
So we invented a new way of doing science

221
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,870
我们创造了金融泡沫实验
We created the Financial Bubble Experiment

222
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,550
做法如下 我们监控市场
The idea is the following. We monitor the markets

223
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,150
鉴别出过剩 泡沫
We identify excesses, bubbles

224
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,020
我们做我们的工作 写一份报告
We do our work. We write a report

225
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,290
其中写有我们预计的临界时间
in which we put our prediction of the critical time

226
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,650
我们不发布报告 它是保密的
We don't release the report. It's kept secret

227
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,730
但我们会使用现代加密技术
But with modern encrypting techniques

228
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,750
我们使用哈希算法 我们发布一个公共密匙
we have a hash, we publish a public key

229
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,330
六个月后 我们再发布报告
and six months later, we release the report

230
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,350
而且我们还有认证
and there is authentication

231
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,870
所有这些都是在一个国际资料库中进行
And all this is done on an international archive

232
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,070
再就没有人会说我们发布的报告影响市场了
so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes

233
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,470
我再告诉你们一个最近的分析
Let me tease you with a very recent analysis

234
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,720
2013年5月17日 就在两周前
17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago

235
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,410
我们鉴别出美国股市处在不可持续的道路上
we identified that the U.S. stock market was on an unsustainable path

236
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,600
5月21日 我们在自己的网站上公布
and we released this on our website on the 21st of May

237
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,640
市场状况会发生更迭
that there will be a change of regime

238
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,090
第二天 市场果然就开始发生变化
The next day, the market started to change regime, of course

239
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,920
这次不是崩盘
This is not a crash

240
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,670
这只是大型泡沫形成过程中的第三或第四次动作
This is just the third or fourth act of a massive bubble in the making

241
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,500
将讨论扩大到整个地球的规模 我们也看到相同现象
Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet, we see the same thing

242
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,420
不管在什么地方 这都是可观测的
Wherever we look, it's observable:

243
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,650
在生物圈中 在大气中 在海洋中
in the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean

244
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,550
都有这种超指数变化轨迹
showing these super-exponential trajectories

245
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,800
表现出不可持续的路径 预示着相变的发生
characterizing an unsustainable path and announcing a phase transition

246
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,510
右侧这张图
This diagram on the right

247
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,510
展示了一份精美的研究
shows a very beautiful compilation of studies

248
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,220
未来数十年内 可能存在一个非线性的重大转变
suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibility

249
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,740
未来数十年内 可能存在一个非线性的重大转变
for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades

250
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,920
可见 泡沫到处都是
So there are bubbles everywhere

251
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,950
从某一方面看 这很令人兴奋
From one side, this is exciting

252
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,350
特别是对于我 我是一个追逐泡沫的教授 一个屠龙者
for me, as a professor who chases bubbles, and slays dragons

253
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,090
媒体有时这样称呼我
as the media has sometimes called me

254
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,050
但我们真的有能力屠龙吗
But can we really slay the dragons?

255
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,660
就在最近 和协作者一同
Very recently, with collaborators

256
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,370
我们研究了一个动态系统
we studied a dynamical system

257
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,270
这里龙王是这些大的循环
where you see the dragon-king as these big loops

258
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,190
我们能够在正确时间施加微弱调整
and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times

259
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,890
在控制开启的条件下除掉这些龙王
that removed, when control is on, these dragons

260
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,150
统治是计划和预测的艺术
Governing is the art of planning and predicting

261
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,420
但这却是人类目前为止最大的空白领域之一
But is it not the case that this is probably one of the biggest gaps of mankind

262
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,770
在日益增多的挑战和危机面前
which has the responsibility to steer

263
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,570
我们有义务将我们的社会 我们的地球
our societies and our planet toward sustainability in the face

264
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,630
引向可持续发展的道路
of growing challenges and crises?

265
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,160
还好 龙王理论提供了希望
But the dragon-king theory gives hope

266
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,390
我们了解到 绝大多数系统具有可预测性
We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability

267
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,810
发展出先进危机诊断技术是可能的
It is possible to develop advanced diagnostics of crises

268
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,850
这样一来我们就能做好准备 就能采取措施
so that we can be prepared, we can take measures

269
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,520
就能担起责任
we can take responsibility

270
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:43,210
进而让大衰退或欧洲危机这样的极端情况
and so that never again will extremes and crises like the Great Recession

271
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,620
不再出乎我们意料 不再让我们不知所措
or the European crisis take us by surprise

272
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,150
谢谢
Thank you
